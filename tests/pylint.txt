 PyLint
========

We'd like to keep the code quality high - pylint helps us do that.

Setup
-----

We need the pylint package - we can get by running: 'easy_install pylint'

Once installed, we can import it

>>> import pylint

Or we can run it from the command line

>>> import subprocess
>>> proc = subprocess.Popen(['pylint'],
...                         stdout=subprocess.PIPE,
...                         stderr=subprocess.PIPE)
>>> print proc.stdout.readline().strip()
Usage:  pylint [options] module_or_package

Code quality
------------

Now we can verify that our code is high-quality

>>> proc = subprocess.Popen(['pylint', 'seshell.py'],
...                         stdout=subprocess.PIPE,
...                         stderr=subprocess.PIPE)
>>> print proc.stdout.read().strip()

>>> proc = subprocess.Popen(['pylint', 'checkconf.py'],
...                         stdout=subprocess.PIPE,
...                         stderr=subprocess.PIPE)
>>> print proc.stdout.read().strip()
