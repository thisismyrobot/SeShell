 SeShell

SeShell (SErial to SHELL converter) allows the mapping of input strings to
shell commands, using regular expressions. If the regular expression matches
sections in () then those matches are passed as arguments to the shell
command.

It doesn't run in it's own right, yet, but if you want to see what it can do,
